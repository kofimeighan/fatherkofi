# Who is Kofi!
From West palm Beach, Florida I am a currently a student at Columbia University studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Iâ€™m interested in bringing unique mixes of hip-hop, r&b, soul, vapor trap, pluggnb, and so many more genres to the streets of New York City. This page is a musical journal of all my archived mixes and performances.

# Mixes
I have a mix series called GTA Radio, where I mix anything and everything you could possibly hear while playing GTA.
